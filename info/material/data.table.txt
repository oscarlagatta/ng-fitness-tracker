Data Table Filtering
---------------------

Filtering for the data table just works.

But why does it work?

Why can we enter "bur" and we find "Burpees"? Why can we enter "0" and we find all entries with "0.1" in them?

Here's how the default filtering algorithm works: It (= Angular Material Data Table) concatenates all row values to a single string AND transforms this string to lowercase.

If you row data is:

Burpees 0.1 3

the filtering string would be burpees0.13

If you then enter "Bur" , it'll match this with this string and search for any occurrences. That's why we should transform our filtering text to lowercase.

If you don't want the default behavior, you can define your own filtering logic by setting the filterPredicate  property instead of the filter property.

The filterPredicate  property takes a function as a value which in turn takes two arguments: The data object (representing the data of one row) and the filtering string. You can then return true in the function if you find that it should match.
