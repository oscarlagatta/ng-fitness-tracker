After version 6 the imports syntax changed, so you may need to install rxjs-compat
To ensure is compatible with previous versions

If you want to make it work without that package (which would have the advantage of saving some kbs on the final bundle), you'll have to do one simple adjustment:

import { Subject } from 'rxjs';

instead of

import { Subject } from 'rxjs/Subject';

and

import { Subscription } from 'rxjs';

instead of

import { Subscription } from 'rxjs/Subscription';

And that will be the general theme for the course by the way. Directly import from 'rxjs'  instead of 'rxjs/Something' .
